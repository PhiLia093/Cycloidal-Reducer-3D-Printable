## Applications in Robotics

Cycloidal drives are widely used in **robotic arms (e.g., industrial robots, collaborative robots)** because of their:

* High reduction ratios in a compact form
* Excellent torque density
* Low backlash for precise positioning

This project demonstrates the ability to take a concept from **theory → CAD modeling → toleranced design → prototype-ready hardware**, with a clear path to scaling for professional robotics use cases.
